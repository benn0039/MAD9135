# Angular ToDo List
=========
The purpose of this assignment is to create a simple AngularJS web app with a single view.

The single view has three parts: a header; a text input with button; and a list.

When the user enters input into the text field and taps the button, the text from the input will be added as a new item in the list.

Each item in the list will have a remove button. Tapping on the remove button will remove the item from the interface as well as from the internal data model.

When the app launches there should be a default list of three items which are loaded from the local data model.
